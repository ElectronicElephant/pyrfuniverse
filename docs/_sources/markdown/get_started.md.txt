# Get Started

## Installation

Follow the steps below to configure and run the sample scene through the published version:

1. Download the [RFUniverse Releases](https://github.com/mvig-robotflow/rfuniverse/releases) and unzip it:
   
    Run the program once, enter the scene and then close it:
   
    Linux：`RFUniverse_For_Linux/RFUniverse.x86_64`
   
    Windows：`RFUniverse_For_Windows/RFUniverse.exe`

2. Clone the pyrfuniverse, switch to the Tag with the <font color=red>**same version number**</font> as the RFUniverse Release (e.g. v0.9.10):
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mvig-robotflow/pyrfuniverse.git
   cd pyrfuniverse
   git checkout v0.9.10
   ```

3. Create a conda environment and activate it, install the 'pyrfuniverse' package with the <font color=red>**same version number**</font> as the RFUniverse Release (e.g. v0.9.10):
   
   ```bash
   conda create -n rfuniverse python=3.8 -y
   conda activate rfuniverse
   pip install pyrfuniverse==0.9.10
   ```

4. Run any Python script under 'pyrfuniverse/Test' (some scripts may require installation of large packages such as 'pybullet', 'open3d', etc.):
   
   ```bash
   cd Test
   python test_pick_and_place.py
   ```

## Enter Edit mode

For users who are not familiar with Unity Editor, we also develop a GUI executable file where users can edit their own scenes and save to a JSON file. The JSON file can be loaded when instanciating RFUniverse environment.

Launch RFUniverse with the <-edit> parameter to enter Edit mode:

Linux:

```
RFUniverse.x86_64 -edit
```

Windows:

```
RFUniverse.exe -edit
```

For loading JSON file during runtime, please see [this code segment](load_json) for detail.
